# Leaf disease detection using Convolutional Neural Network algorithm
The dataset of the leaves has been taken from PlantVillage (GitHub). The dataset used here is apple segmented leaves.
This project is used to identify the type of disease in the plant.
The project was developed in Google Colab, so it has drive locations.

Here is the accompanying paper for this project: [Leaf disease detection using Convolutional Neural Network algorithm](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-15-7106-0_24)


# Steps to run:
1 .Run the model file.

2 .Run the train file.

3 .Run the test file.
